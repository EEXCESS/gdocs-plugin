### End-users

You can simply install this addon from the Google Add-On Store by either

- searching for "E-Explorer" in the store

You will need to be logged in with your Google Account to do this.

3. Create for each file in the repository a file in the script editor with the same name and content (File -> New -> ...)
4. Save all created files and set the project's name.
