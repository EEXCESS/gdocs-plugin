## How this addon works

You can simply install this addon from the Google Add-On Store by either
 1. navigating directly to it https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/e-explorer/ldhpoddoeakgahcoammcpkbchphakcmh, or 
 2. searching for "E-Explorer" in the store. 
 3. Activate the plugin (Top Menu: Addons -> E-Explorer -> Start)
 4. Select a piece of text or use the search bar to search for recommendations. After a short while the recommendations will be displayed in the sidebar.

You will need to be logged in with your Google Account to do this. 

The add-on installation is tied to your Google Account, so it works in all your documents (when you are logged in). 

## Troubleshooting
In case the menue only shows "E-Explorer->Help" and "Start" is missing, do the following:

- click on "Addons->Manage Add-ons" 
- Select E-Explorer and "Activate for this document"
- RELOAD the document in the browser

## Source Code

The source code can be found ( and edited ) directly inside the browser. If you want to do this, you have to open the Script Editor ( Top Menu: Tools -> Script Editor ).

## Texts for Docs add-on deployment

### Post-install tip

Open the E-Explorer by going to Add-ons > E-Explorer > Start
